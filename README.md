# Hidden Ventures Beyond The Spotlight - Exploring the magic of the Laterna Magica 
*by Team Project:ING*

## Premise
For our third-semester project, we were tasked with inventing a “virtual reality application about a museum exhibit” for an exhibition in a museum of our choice. The project should follow the slogan: “Hidden Ventures Beyond The Spotlight“. The idea is to expand on the principles of an exhibit and explore their hidden potentials.

## Background
The laterna magica as a projection device was the predecessor of modern film and widely spread throughout Europe between the 17th and 20th century. In the past, this device filled its audience with a sense of wonder - and thus it received its name “magic lantern”. New immersive worlds were created out of nowhere - worlds that the audience loved to discover. One of these magic lanterns can be examined inside of the Deutsches Filmmuseum in Frankfurt.

The problem with museums nowadays is that people get increasingly disinterested in visiting them. What solution could there be to encourage people to become more interested in museums and their exhibits? Our group Project:ING wanted to solve that exact problem, to make people engage more with museum exhibits again. More specifically, we wanted to expand on this sense of magic and immersion that the historical laterna magica created in the past.

## Final Prototype Outline
Our final prototype contains the feature of inserting cartridges and switching between different 3D-projected worlds. The user can carry the Lantern and manually insert different cartridges. The projection shader allows for projecting a 3D scene into an existing 3D space. The user has three distinct environments to choose from, all with their very own atmosphere and visual direction.
